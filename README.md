# change-point-in-time-series
Nonstationarity is a commonly found phenomenon in statistic. By partitioning the nonstationary data into several contiguous stationary segments, the notion of locally stationary models has become a popular device. There are many ways to estimate the change-point. So, I am trying to implement these ways with R programming.
